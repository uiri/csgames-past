Given two numbers, calculate the quotiet and the remainder of the Euclidean Division.

Be careful, you will need to deal with negative numbers following the purest, most exact and rigid of mathematical traditions:

 * The remainder is never negative or superior (inclusively) to the absolute value of the divisor.
 * The dividend is always equal to the sum of the remainder and the product of the quotient by the divisor.

Examples:

> -50 / 3 -> quotient = -17 et reste = 1
>
> 70 / -8 -> quotient = -87 et reste = 4
>
> -175 / -33 -> quotient = 6 et reste = 23
