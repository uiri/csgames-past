# Le jeu du pélican (règles simplifiés pour jouer à 2).

Each player throws a six-faced dice:

* If both players get the save value, the game stops and the player with the most artichokes wins.
* Otherwise, the player with the biggest value wins as many artichokes as the difference.
* Additionnally, if a player obtains a 6, he wins 17% of his opponents artichokes.
* But, if a player obtains a 1 and the other a 6, the number of artichokes of both players is reset to 0. Three more matches
	are played and the winner is the player who wins two fo the three new matches.

In order to determine the size of the buckets of dices, what is the average count of dice throws for a matchup?
