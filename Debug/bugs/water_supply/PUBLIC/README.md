# Water Supply

The Water Supply Operation System consist of a network of complex elements with pipes (to let the water flow), basins (to store water), and filters (to block unwanted material like mud, radioactive rats and filthy non-citizens).

All the elements of the system were all designed and supervised by trained professionals. They are extremely dangerous and humid and should not be attempted by anyone, anywhere, anytime.

Therefore, most of the maintenance is automatic but require highly precise mathematical computations.
Even the slightest imprecision error, in any results, might cause pipes to leak, basins to overflow or, worse, floods of refugees.

## Description

The program reads a single integer from the standard output, then:

* displays all its factors (in a increasing order)
* indicates if the number is prime.

## Developers

In fact, we are not completely sure what is the language used.
You must do your best to debug the program without being able to test it yourself.

Some sample tests are available anyway:
