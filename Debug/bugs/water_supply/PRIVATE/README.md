# Fear Factor

See PUBLIC/README

## Wat?

The language used is Mpire, the made-up language used for the Compilation Competition.
The point here is that the candidate do not know the language nor can even run it because there is no interpreter yet.

## Bugs List

* starts factors at 2
* stop before the last number
* compare modulo to 1 (instead of 0)
* 1 is not prime!

## Requirements and Installation

This challenge requires on the PRIVATE site that the `mpire` interpreter is available.
