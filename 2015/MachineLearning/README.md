# MachineLearningChallenge
The 2015 CS Games machine learning challenge

## The Challenge
The Challenge_Students folder is what should be given to the contestant. Everything in the folder should be available. Also, some basic api should be given to the students, as the will not have access to the web.

## The Correction
Use the ChallengeCorrection folders to correct the student answers. 
Simply replace the Solution files by the solution files made by the students and run. 
It will give you the success rate of each algorithm.

You should be aware that this problem can quite easily be solve with a little data mining (using the given data). It is up to you to give the directives on which algorithm is accepted and make the correction accordingly.

## The data generation
the data generator is in python. It is very hard coded. It was tweaked until it gave me data acceptable for the challenge.
I would highly recommend not using it and using your own data. you're competition will just be better.
