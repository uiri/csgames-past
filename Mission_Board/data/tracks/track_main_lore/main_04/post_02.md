Over time, small surviving clans began to form, which widened to become factions, manufacturer of new towns with the means at hand. Over time, each faction has become a micro society with its rules and leaders. Later they even came to realize that they were not alone and began to communicate with each other. One of these factions, the elite, was more advanced and powerful than the others, they even had scientifics and began to rehabilitate the technology that had been neglected during the period when the only purpose of humanity was to survive.

The elite were led by a benevolent and beloved leader who had the particularity of having more than 200 years. It is the only human being whose genetic mutation caused his cells to be able to regenerate forever, making him potentially immortal, facing old age at least. Since he started to mutate, he stopped aging. After a moment, a little over 200 years after the disaster, the various factions decided to join their forces, forming the coalition. As the elite were the most advanced at that time, and that their leader was reputed to be wise and benevolent because of his age, it was decided that he would be the leader of the coalition. He would be accompanied by a restricted council, to help him make and apply decisions.
