Shortly after the unification of the factions, a new hope is born for humanity: the creation of the Montreal dome. Indeed, radiation began to dissipate, and by combining their knowledge and expertise, the coalition factions began a large project. The goal was to live in town, in a large dome around Montreal. The dome being there for several reasons: protection against external radiation (which even if they were weaker than before, were still aggressive enough), regulate the temperature and air quality, in short, provide a sustainable environment for humanity. The project took several decades to materialize, but after time an efforts, mankind had created a stronghold in which it could start over, waiting for the general state of the world to improve. 

Under the dome, life was good, some buildings were restored and some even rebuilt, the technology was present almost everywhere, to meet the different needs. There was even fruits, vegetables, and animals. In short, this very long period of famine and fear was over. The leader and his restricted council were very efficient and were acting for the good of all. A society with everything it needs (police, doctors, farmers etc ...)was bornl. Occasionally, survivors and even new factions were joining the dome, and were welcomed warmly.

To celebrate this new start, the coalition renamed itself, the Republic was born.
