Humanity disappeared gradually. Some were highly resistant to radiation and could survive with almost no scars, others began to mutate genetically, the remainder all dead... Some of the mutated were even upgraded in the process. There are some of the survivors that acquired superhuman strength, others could now see in the dark, etc ... In this chaos, cities have become uninhabitable because too radioactive, even for those resistant. The wildlife started dying at the same rate as mankind, the air became less and less breathable

The beginning of this disaster also marked the beginning of a new era in which we live today, the Alpha era. 

A period of a hundred years of despair ensued... During that time, humanity almost disappeared, everyone was trying to survive as best as they could. The survivors joined the places least affected by radiation, where the vegetation and the animals were not all dead. The oxygen in the air began to dwindle because of the lack of vegetation. People started to wear gas masks, which also brought them oxygen. For some, it was possible to survive without a mask, but it was thanks to their mutation, which allowed them to need less oxygen.
