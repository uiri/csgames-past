The effects of these pills were even better than what they had imagined, so they were given the name NZT. Overwhelmed with pride, UQAMians decided to make their project public and sell NZT worldwide. Of course, they kept the formula secret. As the organizers of the CS Games 2016, they said it would be a good way to inflate the budget of that year!

After a few months people realized that pills emitted light radiation. As this was quite alarming, major scientists around the world began to study them carefully (using it of course, since it was boosting their intellectual abilities). It turned out that their composition was such as the more time passed, the more the radiations they issued were powerful. Even several months after having ingested them, the radioactive part of their composition remained in people's bodies. People became more and more radioactive, to the point of dying in agony.

It is at this point that the situation degenerated greatly... Almost everyone in the world had purchased and took these pills that was killing them slowly, unable to do anything. Eventually, even people who didnâ€™t take them were irradiated by the others and would die anyway. As you can imagine, the 2016 CS Games have never been held ...
