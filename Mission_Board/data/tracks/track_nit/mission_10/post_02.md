# Visit of the Fangorn Forest

One of the point of `nitcc` is to generate the classes of the AST and visit methods.
You can look around in the generated files.

Let's focus on the Logolas format.

There is an abstract cursor (at√πin in Elfish) that start at (0,0) and that is oriented to the right (because elves like to be right).
The x axis goes to the left and the y axis goes to the bottom.

There is 3 basic types of commands:

* forward (`‚≠°`) is used to advance in the current direction, the distance is given by the following number (from 1 to 12).
  Because elves like purity, the final position must be rounded to the nearest integer for x and y. It means that between commands, the at√πin is always at an integer position.
* turn left (`‚Æ¢`) and right (`‚Æ£`) change the current direction.
  The angle is given from 1 to 12 like in a clock (3 means a right angle).
* sequence enclosed between `ùÑÜ` and `ùÑá` are repeated a given number of times indicated after the closing `ùÑá`.
  Note that `‚Ö§` repetitions means that the sequence must be executed 6 times.

## Mission

* Difficulty: hard

Using the classes generated by nitcc, implement a program that computes the final position of the at√πin. The logolas file is given as the first argument of the program.

To help you, three logolas files are proposed:

* an elegant and abstract L letter [maenas](maenas.logolas).
* a glowing and inspiring star [elen](elen.logolas).
* a peaceful and warm house [bar](bar.logolas).

### Template to Use

<!--
~~~nit
module logolas

import logolas_parser
import logolas_lexer

# CODE HERE
~~~-->

<pre class="hl"><span class="hl kwa">module</span> logolas

<span class="hl kwa">import</span> logolas_parser
<span class="hl kwa">import</span> logolas_lexer

<span class="hl slc"># CODE HERE</span>
</pre>

### Expected Result

* for maenas: (1,3)
* for elen: (10,-3)
* for bar: (4,0)
