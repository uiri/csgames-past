# Mission Order

## Pieter Cornelis Mondriaan

Greetings rebel forces,

We have stumbled upon what seems to be a riddle.

One strange caped man with a stupid look gave us an archive, inside it was an image and some guidelines.

The guidelines only said "Send the password to the server, it shall give you the flag. Here is the address: [nit.jeuxcs.org:4637](nit.jeuxcs.org:4637). We count on you."

It looks like the image is the centerpiece of the puzzle.

Can you find what is hidden within ?

Here's the link to said image: [Trollkod](trollkod.png)

**Mission Type:** Reverse-Engineering

**Objectives:**

Give the password to the server, the flag will be your reward.
