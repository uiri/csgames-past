"The success of the operation is mitigated.

Our battalion has first surrounded the entire city, making sure not to let anyone escape. We then attacked the Benelux to destroy it and capture all rebel forces therein. To our surprise, no one was there. They must have known we were coming…

To leave no witnesses, we destroyed the entire city and killed everybody.

In conclusion, the main objective has been accomplished, and the secondary objective is a failure, since there were no rebels. Nevertheless, the complete destruction of the city has kept this operation secret , we left no traces."
