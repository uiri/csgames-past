Information excavation report outside the dome made by a spy of the Empire :

"Report No. 9 spy 404: 10 Iridium α666

After several months of field investigation, I finally found sensitive information about the organization of the rebellion. A drunk guy in a bar could not help but brag about belonging to the rebellion the other evening. I just had to give him some more drinks and ask the right questions to get what I wanted. I made him think I wanted to join the rebellion and so I wanted to know the location of their headquarters to go there directly.

According to him, the headquarters of the rebellion is in the city of a small faction in the northwest called Pallet Town. It’s a  bar named Benelux .Rebellion leaders often meet there to organize their operations. Unfortunately I have not managed to get more information as to their frequency of meeting nor to particular dates."
