"VERY IMPORTANT: The Empire possesses a secret base in the form of mines that enable it to obtain key resources it needs to make his weapons and improve the technology of the Dome.

The Morriar mines are located about 15km Southeast of the dome. They are connected to the dome via an underground tunnel. The mining network is entirely underground, in order to remain as discreet as possible. There are some accesses to the surface, I will communicate them in my next report, I have not obtained their exact location yet. The mines are guarded by an elite battalion armed to the teeth, and the fact that they are underground makes their defense better.

A strategic attack on these mines could cripple technological advancement and proper operation of the dome for a while. This is a good opportunity to weaken the Empire, at least temporarily.

Also, if you manage a lightning attack, you will surely be able to recover most of the technologies used on site, which is significant."
