## Information Gathering

**Objective:**
We found some pages of a millitiaman’s journal in the dome’s garbage. Unfortunately, almost all of it was unreadable, and the only paragraph we recovered is encrypted. You must decrypt this paragraph, it may contain important informations about the Empire.

**Encoded data:**

> Today, the butcher came to interrogate dissidents before they are expelled from the dome. As always, it was horrible ... All day, almost inhuman cries came from the room down the hall, the one he uses for "questioning". I do not know exactly what's going on, but I already had the opportunity to see the results, people come out extremely mutilated, often dead than alive. Of the 20 people he interviewed today, only 8 survived.
> 
> I do not know if I can stand it much longer. I saw what he had done to one of his victims today ... He engraved a message to the skin of this poor person, knife: flag{F3aR_Th3_BU7cH3r}.
> 
> I wonder if people know what it does? I have the impression that only a few militiamen who are part of his inner circle know his true nature. No one seems to suspect him of anything ...
