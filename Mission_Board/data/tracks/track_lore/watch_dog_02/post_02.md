## What does the Empire know?

**Description:**
Description: Watch Dog is in a really bad situation, the empire found out that the rebellion has an infiltrated agent! We don’t know exactly what kind of information they have on the mole, but we intercepted a record of a conversation between some members of the restricted council. Unfortunately, the conversation is encrypted.

**Objective:**
Decrypt the conversation and find what the empire exactly knows about the mole. If they don’t already know who it is, there may be a way to save Watch Dog!


**Conversation:**
>P1: Why did you want to see us, P3 ?
P3: I have some really important informations,  and I can only trust you and P2.
P2: What ? Which kind of informations ?
P3: Aparently, there’s a mole in the Empire, working for the rebellion. It’s either a member of the militia, one of the govenors or even onee of us, restricted council…
P1: What are you talking about, it’s impossible! Who told you that ?
P3: One of the dissidents spoke while being interrogated by the militia.
P2: Did he told anymore informations ? A name maybe ? It would be easier with a name …
P3: Nothing else, he died trying to keep his mouth shut. We need to find this mole as fast as possible, with the CS Games, we can’t afford that something we don’t control happens.
P1: Agreed, let’s open an investigation on all important members of the empire.We’ll investigate on the militia after the CS Games, for now we need to be sure nothing bad happens.
P3: Ok. I’ll set some of our special investigators on the case, I’ll be in touch if they find anything”
