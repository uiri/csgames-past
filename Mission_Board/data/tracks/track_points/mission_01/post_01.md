## Points

Hi Rebels !

Since we are nice people, we provide you with a ton of ways to gather points for your teams.

One is by sticking QR Codes everywhere in the University for you to scan, don't hesitate to run through every hall of the building looking for these ! They may be very well hidden, as such look around carefully, you don't want to miss an opportunity to score !

But be minful of your surroundings, don't go and break stuff right :)

Good luck everyone !
