# Mystery Man

Once again dear Rebel, we call upon to your help.

We are looking for someone's identity.
The only thing we know is that he lived in the old era, this man has been involved in the creation of music in his own time.

We need the man's last name only, capital letters do not matter.

In our archives, we found some extracts from pieces he helped produce, we conviently arranged them to have one file only.

The file is available [here](mystery_man_soundtrack.mp3).

Can you please help us ?

**Mission Type:** Recon

**Objectives:**

Find the mystery man's last name.
