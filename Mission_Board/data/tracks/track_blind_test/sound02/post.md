# Mission Order

## Familiar Sounds

Rebel forces, we have received a transmission from a european rebellion cell.
It appears they are looking for the identity of an old-era musician, though they could not find it.

[This](transmission.mp3) is the message we have received, it is spoken with the most awful accent we've ever heard, try listening to it carefully, maybe there will be some clues as to whom they are looking for.

[This](familiar.mp3) is the file they attached.

**Mission Type:** Recon

**Objectives:**

Who is the man they are looking for ? Give us his last name only, surely this will be enough.
