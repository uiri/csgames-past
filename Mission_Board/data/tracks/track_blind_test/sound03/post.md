# Mission Order

## Torture Sounds

Rebel forces, we need your help more than ever.

An expedition found old recordings in an abandoned torture room.

The images are not disclosed by our forces to keep a small amount of sanity amongst the Rebel following.

But... We need to uncover the truth behind these recordings...

We have compiled extracts from what we found.
Audio only, the images going with them are too unbearable for anyone to see...
The recording is available [here](torture_sounds.mp3).

Some of our bests elements have gone crazy from what they have seen.

Please, uncover the sadistic spirit behind these recordings...
The last name will suffice.

Do not use capital letters when sending the name, this animal can not ever be recognized as a decent human being...

We are counting on you... Please, help the souls this man claimed his own ever find peace.

**Mission Type:** Recon

**Objectives:**

Find the butcher's last name.
