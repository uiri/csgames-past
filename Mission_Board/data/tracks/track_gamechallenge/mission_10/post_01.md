## Songs from the past

Dear rebel, we need you !

We have found a relic from the old times which needs your help to unravel the secrets within.

One particular file has been discovered which could help us avoid the Great Disaster from a thousand years ago, this is vital information to the rebellion and mankind.

[This](sound_desc.snd) file is believed to contain the long lost patition of a song, we need its name.

Maybe, if you could use your machines to play it, you could bring back its glory.

From what we have gathered about the file itself, it seems to be structured in two parts;

* The first line contains the information of the total length of the song, followed by a sampling rate
* Each following line contains the information of a note, first is the length which need to be played, and its frequency.

We believe square waves should be sufficient to get a grasp of the melody.

We are counting on you, our destiny... no, the world's destiny is at stake !

### Objectives
