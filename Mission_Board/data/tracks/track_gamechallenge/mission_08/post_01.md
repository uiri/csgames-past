## Patience

Rebel forces,

We have uncovered a special version of an old game for a long-lost game console.

In this game, one of the monsters featured has changed its name.

Can you spot the creature whose name has changed and send us its new name ?
The name must be provided in the UQAM{NAME} format.

We count on you.

[This](wrong_name.gbc) is the game you must play.

## Objectives

* Find the new name of one of the creatures.
