## Nonogram madness

We have uncovered the description of an old-era style puzzle during an expedition of the scouting legion.

It apparently describes what was once a great threat to lifeforms in the galaxy.

Can you solve the puzzle and send us the name of said creature ?

The file appears to be split in two sections, separated by a '-' token:

* The first part represents the column constraints
* The second part represents the line constraints

If we took the example of such a file for a simple figure, it would look like this:

    0 0 1 1 0
    1 2 1 1 5
    -
    0 1
    0 2
    1 1
    1 1
    0 5

And would yield the following image:

        *
       **
      * *
     *  *
    *****

[This](nonogram.txt) is the input file we were given.
