Dear Diary,

It's probably the last time we speak. At the time I write this, I hear the militia coming closer. He did it. Neven denounced me. I'll be imprisoned and banned from the dome, as others before me.

It is only now that it crosses my mind, but how is life outside the dome? Will I be able to adapt? Will the radiation kill me, if I survive the interrogations of the militia? So many questions that will be answered soon, against my willingless.

It's almost the time for truth, will Neven realize what he has become, seeing the militia taking me? I hope so. I hear the heavy footsteps of the militiamen that mount the stairs, my heart is racing, I’m starting to panic. Wish me luck, dear diary. Farewell. And do not forget, I do not lose hope of recovering my Neven one day!
