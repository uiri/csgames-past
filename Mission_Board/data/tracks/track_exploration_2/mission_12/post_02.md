Dear Diary,

Today I'll tell you how was my expulsion of the dome.

That day, once again, I was curled up in the back of my cell, almost dying. At this stage of my imprisonment, I expected only one thing: that the Sergeant McGregor went too far in his next interrogation and kill me unintentionally. I could not stand the pain anymore, and he reduced my mind to nothing since a long time.

It was at that moment I heard footsteps coming closer to my cell. To my surprise, those footsteps were not consistent with the approach of McGregor. The door opened, and a guard of the militia came to help me up and brought me into the yard of the prison. There, they had gathered several prisoners. When I arrived at the prison, I remember making a remark to myself: This courtyard looked strangely like a place to carry out executions. For a moment, I said to myself "Finally, it's over ...".

They gathered us all together in a corner of the yard. Against all odds, they then gave us a few things: a little water, a little to eat, and a gas mask. This is where I realized that I was going to be expelled from the dome shortly. During most of my captivity, I have been thinking to Neven or the fact that I would rather be dead than imprisoned in this cursed prison, tortured almost every day. So I did not really think about my expulsion.
