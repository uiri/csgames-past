Dear Diary,

I do not know what day it is. I do not know how long I spent imprisoned at the hands of the empire's militia. Apparently I got out of it, since I am writing to you today. It was a living hell. I could never put into words what they did to me, it was just horrible.

Despite this, a new hope was born during my captivity. It is thanks to Neven if I write to you today, he made his connections work for me to keep a few personal effects while being expelled from the dome.

Yes, you read correctly, I am outside the dome. I'm not dead yet, and I do not intend to die any soon.

During my captivity, I had the opportunity to be interrogated  by Sergeant McGregor. All I heard about him was really far away from reality. To me, he is the incarnation of the devil. I did not know it was possible for a human being to be like him, it is simply unimaginable. He mutilated me repeatedly asking me questions I could not answer, about the dissident group to which I belonged. After some time, I cracked and gave everything. But that did not stop him, he continued torturing me for days and days, for his own pleasure. Curled deep in my cell, I heard him living and saying to the guards "I'm sure he’s still hiding important information, and he will give them to me!".

But this is not the worst thing he ever did ...

I'm exhausted, I have to sleep, I would tell you the rest of the story tomorrow.
