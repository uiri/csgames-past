Once that about half of dissidents were banished, I began to realize that the young woman in front of me could not keep it up. Without warning, she began to run the faster she could toward the entrance through which we had arrived in front of the gates. She surely hoped to be able to run fast enough to leave the militia behind, and go hide somewhere in the dome. Some militiamen began to follow  her instantly, but McGregor ordered them to stop. They then turned to him, not understanding. There he made the sign: he brandished before his closed fist with the thumb down ... The militiamen then turned back to the poor young woman, aimed and fired ... That’s what awaited us if we tried to escape... McGregor then scratched her name from the list and started to call the others, one by one.

Gradually, as my turn approached, I was more and more paralyzed. I think at one point I almost wanted to take my chances as the young woman before me. I looked behind me, and her body was still here, laying down on the ground, it was enough to dissuade me ... That's when I noticed that there were some places on the floor next to us who were a little darker. This surely were poorly cleaned traces, showing the horrors that occurred in front of these doors.
