That's it, it was my turn. McGregor was standing a few meters from me. He looked at his sheet and said, "Neven Ness, come."

Neven ?! I did not understand what was hapenning. Why did he ask my husband to come? I began to consider the worst ... I looked Neven, he seemed as surprised as me. In his eyes, I could see that he had no desire to obey this order, he too was afraid of subsequent events.

Once Neven arrived, McGregor gave him the paper he held. With a big smile, he then said: "It is thanks to you that we were able to stop that one, so the honor of finishing the work by banishing him yourself from the dome is yours".

I was devastated, it was probably the worst time of my life. McGregor had ordered Neven to banish me himself  from the dome ... Facing this order, I saw the reaction of Neven. He was shaking as much as me. Yet he had no more choice than me, so he began: "Smash Ness, you're guilty ...". I could not watch him, why was this happening? I could not conceive that the last time I saw him was like that …

While he was pronounning the sentence, Neven stopped talking. He tried to continue, but he began to stutter. I then looked at him, he had tears in his eyes and couldn’t breath. It was evident, him either could not bear what was happenning. He managed somehow to finish his speech. It was time, it was the moment I had to get out of the dome, give up everything, to be delivered to a new world of which I knew nothing about. I could not move, I was staring at Neven. His tears, which I witnessed while he was talking to me a priori for the last time, were not lying. He had just realized how much a mistake he made by denouncing me, and how much he still loved me.
