15 Gallium α511

Dear Diary,

That's it, it happened... Today Tuches announced that the men in their family became part of the Imperial militia. Women remain in care of the farm while they maintain order under the dome.

"Policing the dome", what a nonsense! At the time of the Republic, there was no need to "maintain order in the dome." Everyone lived in harmony, life was beautiful …

I increasingly fear, dear diary. My distaste for the Empire keeps growing. Am I becoming a dissident? If this is the case, no one other than myself can know. Otherwise, the worst will happen to me: expulsion from the Dome... If this happens, I do not think I could survive in the outside world.

Neven, my love, does not seem so preoccupied about the situation. He said we should wait, and that with time, everything will work out. Believing this is getting increasingly difficult.
