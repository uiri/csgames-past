12 Antimony α512

Dear Diary,

It's getting worse, I just heard some terrible news ... Neven has enrolled in the Imperial militia! What could have happened? Everything went so fast. He changed so much, so quickly... How can this be possible?

It’s been a few months since our views differed more and more, but I never thought it would come to this. All this can only be the fault of those damned neighbours, the Tuches. They put these horrible ideas in his head. I will never forgive them.

Did I lose everything? My faith in the Empire disappeared long ago. Neven was the last pillar that still maintained the foundation for any hope of a happy life.
What will I become, now that I can no longer count on him either? I would do everything in my power to try to recover my love.
