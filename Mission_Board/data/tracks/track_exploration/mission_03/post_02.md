Dear Diary,

Last night we went to dinner at the Tuches. It was horrible. They told us some of their missions as militiamen, it sent chills up my spine. They take dissidents directly from their home without any kind of warning to imprison them for questioning before finally expelling them from the Dome. They even proudly claimed of having conducted some tough interrogations.

The Imperial militia is organized into battalions, squads, etc... They also spoke about their unit leader, Sergeant McGregor. Apparently, he is the most radical man in the unit. According to their description, he appears to be a true psychopath. When he conducts interviews, respondents are rarely unscathed. He's a monster, some say he has fun torturing people...

What made me suffer the most is that Neven did not seem shocked by what he heard. Back home, we argued quite violently. I did not understand why he wasn’t offended about what he heard. He seemed to agree with these methods. He worries me...
