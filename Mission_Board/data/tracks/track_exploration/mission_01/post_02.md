Dear Diary,

Since the last time, the situation has kept on deteriorating... The militia hunts and bans from the dome anyone not agreeing the imperial policy. Gradually, several movements are created within the dome. Supporters of the empire help militiamen finding dissidents while these hide and try to find a way to restore the old way of life under the dome.

In these dark days, it's hard to trust people. Even friends begin to suspect each other. Besides, our neighbours and longtime friends, the Tuche family, are slowly radicalizing. I'm afraid, dear diary. What will happen to the dome? Fortunately Neven is there and I can count on him. He is the light of my life and that's what allows me not to lose my head. But how long will it last?
