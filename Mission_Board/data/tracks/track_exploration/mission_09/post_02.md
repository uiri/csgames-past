Dear Diary,

Neven knows, I'm sure. I do not know how, but he knows that I am an active dissident. This must be because lately, I am less and less at the farm the evenings, and increasingly in clandestine bars filled with dissidents. With the rise of my conviction to fight the empire, I also started to discuss his "career choice". So we resumed our arguments ... He has not turned back his convictions, despite my numerous interventions.

Like I've said before, I think he will denounce me. He still loves me, you know, but how long will it take before it is no longer enough to protect me from the militia?

If he denounces me, I may be able to take advantage of this. This will be the last test, the one that will determine whether he can still be saved from his madness. I do not lose hope.
