Dear Diary,

It's been a few years since I have not talked to you, how are you? I am a little confused. I was born, I grew up and I was raised under the Dome, I have known nothing else in my entire life. I was told that the outside world that is in ruins, and that survival is very difficult, so I consider myself as a lucky person. Fortunate to live under the dome, which actually seems to be the most beautiful place on earth. So far I have lived a rather ordinary life. I followed my father's footsteps by taking over the family farm, I met the love of my life, Neven. We live together at the farm, we divide the work, which even allowed to enlarge it a little.

Nevertheless, the climate inside the dome has changed in recent years. When I was young, we were ruled by a benevolent and just Republic, but many things have started to change when it was replaced by the Empire. Since this change, inequality began to rise, and the general atmosphere within the dome has deteriorated. At first, it was not much, but over time it has grown and it has now become rather frightening ... Attitudes are changing, it is as if the empire was slowly brainwashing the population. More and more people join the militia of the Empire. I really hope this will not continue or even go further, dear diary.
