Dear Diary,

I do not know where I am. Last night I went to a bar. I wanted to get away from the heavy atmosphere that prevails at the farm since a few months ... I've been with some friends, the only ones I feel to be able to trust again. They share the same ideas as me, especially regarding the Empire and the militia.

Yesterday I even learned that some of them are part of a group of dissidents who do the best they can to remain in the today’s society. They asked me to join them and help them fight the empire in the shadows. I did not know what to say. On one hand, I really want to be able to fight for my values. On the other hand, it’s a very dangerous game, and I do not know if I’ll have the courage.

Also, how am I going to hide this from Neven? If he realizes, he will denounce me, I'm certain of that... I try to take advantage of the fact that he does not like McGregor and his methods to turn him back to normal. It is not working yet, but I keep on hoping.
