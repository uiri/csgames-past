Dear Diary,

It took me some time, but I made it. While some of my friends disappeared, I decided it was time to pay the empire his coin back. I am now "officially" a dissident. We try to hide sought dissidents at other’s members of the group houses, and look for a way to act effectively against the empire.

Unfortunately, my situation does not allow me to hide people at the farm, Neven will notice it too easily. He doesn’t look at me as before, I think he suspects something. I'm still trying to recover him, but no results yet. I do not lose hope.
