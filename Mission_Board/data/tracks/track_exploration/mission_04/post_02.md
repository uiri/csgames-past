Dear Diary,

Everything has gone wrong. With Neven, we quarrel more and more, mostly about the Empire and its radical politics. Right now, he spends more time with the Tuches, I can see him radicalize gradually, and this frightens me.

I hope I can reason him before the situation degenerates.
Wish me luck, dear diary...
