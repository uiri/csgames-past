Dear Diary,

I do not trust anyone. It's as if everyone around me had gone crazy, including Neven. He scares me. Since he joined the Imperial militia, the situation has worsened. The irony is that he is part of the same unit as the Tuches, led by Sergeant McGregor, the crazy man I had already told you about.

Day by day, I hear more and more horrible stories about this man through Neven. Even he does not approve of his methods and thinks he has mental health issues. I hope Neven will be back to the right way, but it will not be easy …

Neven and I aren’t arguing anymore. I’m afraid to stand up to him. I'm afraid he denounces me to the militia. Yes, dear diary, that's where I am. I'm afraid he delivers me in the hands of the horrible militia, and I especially fear McGregor ...
