## GOST in the Shell

Greetings rebel forces,

We received yet another [transmission](mystery_transmission.txt) from another place.

We could not see where this came from, but we roughly attribute the origin of the message to eastern Europe.

Can you help us understand the message inside ?

This might be of vital importance to the rebellion.

Help us, you're our only hope.

NOTE: The password will be with the format UQAM{flag}
