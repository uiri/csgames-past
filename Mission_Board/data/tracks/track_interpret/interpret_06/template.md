## Overflow Chart

Our team of micro-reverse-electronic experts managed to get the blueprint of an Analogical-Complex-Machine-of-the-Empire, a infernal machine that could be the greatest treat against what remain of mankind on Earth.

It is of the utmost importance to understand the inner workings of such an abominable device so we can prevent and counter the sinister machination of the Empire, and also give us the possibility to build our own Machine if we want one for ourselves.

The Machine seems to have only one main data register and some limited random access memory slots.
The data in the register and memory seems to be integers and characters; however, it is not clear how the Machine handle the distinction between both data-types.

The blueprint of the Machine is in the enclosed [file](flow.svg).
